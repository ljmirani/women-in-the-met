# Project One: Female Artists in the Met Museum

For the first Project of the Lede Program 2024 I looked into the representation of female artists in the [Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection) - specifically in the Modern Art Department's permanent Collection. 

## Project Idea

 I was inspired by [this poster](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/849438) of the feminist activist group "Guerilla Girls", whose goal is to fight against underrepresentation of female and PoC artists in the art world. This year marks the 35th anniversary of the poster.

## Data

I used the [ Met Museums API ](https://metmuseum.github.io/) to get the data needed for the project. 

* [This](https://github.com/ljmirani/women-in-the-met/blob/main/Lede_P1_Data%3ACleaning.ipynb) Notebook has the code I used to clean the data
* [This](Lede_P1_Analysis.ipynb) Notebook has the code I used to analyse the data

## Findings

I found that in the last 35 years, there were no significant changes to the number of female artists in the Modern Art permanent collection:


|2024|artworks in collection|1989|artworks in collection|
|---|---|---|---|
|Male|77,6%|Male|80,3%|
|Female|22,4%|Female|19,7%|



## Website

[This](https://ljmirani.github.io/women-in-the-met/) is the website that I created for this project.

## What I learned
* Cleaning data in pandas
* Making graphics, figuring out the basics of ai2html
* Getting frustrated, but eventually working my way through Illustrator

## What I would have liked to do (with more time/skills)
* More time to make better graphics, especially for the scrolly part with the photographs
* More time to write a decent text, that came at the very last second
* Make a better Map
* Scrape the Mets Website for Exhibitions in 2024/1989 to compare the number of exhibitions of female vs. male artists
* Make a cleaner/better repository
* (and so many other things!)
