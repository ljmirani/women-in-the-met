# Project One: Female Artists in the Met Museum
For the first Project of the Lede Program 2024 I looked into the representation of female artists in the ([Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection)) - specifically in the Modern Art Department's permanent Collection. 

 ## Project Idea

 I was inspired by ([this poster ](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/849438)) of the feminist activist group "Guerilla Girls", whose goal is to fight against underrepresentation of female and PoC artists in the art world. This year marks the 35th anniversary of the poster.

## Data

* [Data & Cleaning](Lede_P1_Data:Cleaning.ipynb)  - the notebook, I cleaned my dataframe with pandas in.
* [Analysis](Lede_P1_Analysis.ipynb)- the notebook, I used the data to analyse the gender disparity in the Met Museum



 ## Findings

 I found that in the last 35 years, there were no significant changes to the number of female artists in the Modern Art permanent collection - it stayed around 20 %.
