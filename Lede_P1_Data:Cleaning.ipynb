Through reading the documentation again and browsing the MET website, I found out that the first digits of the accession number contain the Year of aqcuisition as well. The numbers on the 7 remaining rows are between 12-55. Since the Met opened in 1870, the acquisition will not have taken place before, a quick check of the data shows me that the pieces acquired after 2000 show the full year in the acquisition number, so the numbers 12 and 17 refer to 1912 and 1917. As there are only six rows with numbers in them, I will manually fill out the year below."
